LaTeX notes...
===============================

This is my LaTeX report. Compiling it with pdflatex should be normal and should
just work. I embedded a cute little animation in the PDF, which is the figure
showing the envelope of an AM wave. Unfortunately, the only PDF viewer that can
view animations is Adobe Reader. Fortunately, the first frame of the animation
that I did embed is viewable in other PDF viewers, and that's what is needed to
get the essence of that figure anyways.
